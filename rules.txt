GLOBAL RULES
    Do not post in or view any boards if you are under 18 years of age.
    If you break the rules we will delete your post. Do it repeatedly and you'll be derezzed.
    Do not call for mods, or announce reports in a thread.
    Always argue in good faith and avoid using personal attacks.
    You should always elaborate on your opinions rather than just spilling the soykaf.
    Don't respond with aggression to perceived flames or trolls (or at all.)
    Do not whine and cry about 8chan, "quality", "invasions", "newfags", mods, bans, or kalyx outside of /q/.
    Do not spam or advertise unrelated content.
    Do not post child pornography or questionable 2D/3DCG/3DPG sexual depictions of children. This includes "child models".
    If you must post it, spoiler any NSFW content and make sure it's relevant to the discussion.
    Do not upload malicious archives.
    Read the rules again. /* infinite iteration will fix later */


PRO TIPS FOR MAXIMUM FUN:
    The mods are not on powertrips, they are friendly and are trying to ensure the quality of lainchan, not belittle your ideas.
    Lainchan is a place to have your voice heard but not a place for you to drown out others' voices.
    Mods usually ask each other for opinions before doing anything. We hate having to ban someone.
    Just relax and try to have fun. Jokes are always welcome.
    Visit a board you've never been to. Try out /random/.
    Max file size is 35 mb.
    PDF, ePub, and webm are supported across the boards.
    We ALWAYS need contributors to our board software, located on github
    Dice rolling: posting in the email field with the form "dice XdY+/-Z" will result in X Y-sided dice rolled and summed, with the modifier Z added, the result is displayed at the top of the post body.
    Be smart when posting about potentially illegal activities.
